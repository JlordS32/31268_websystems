                     <h3>Reflection</h3>
                     <p>
                        For the context, I already know HTML and CSS, but it's
                        been a while since I have coded in basic HTML and CSS.
                        The limitations imposed on this assessment made me
                        carefully think on what to add and what to not add. This
                        made me realised that even if I could have done better,
                        I still have a lot to learn. I completely overestimated
                        my abilities.

                     <h3>Technology used</h3>
                     <p>
                        As per requirement of the assessment. Only
                        <strong>HTML and CSS</strong> was used on this website.
                     </p>

                  <section class="layout">
                     <h3>Layout</h3>
                     <p>
                        It took me some time deciding what layout to use for
                        this website. I wanted something that was simple, clean,
                        and easy to navigate, yet also offered flexibility for
                        future growth. After considering several options, I
                        eventually settled on a
                        <strong>1-column layout</strong>, which provides a
                        straightforward, focused experience for the user. This
                        layout puts the content in the forefront, so visitors
                        can quickly digest the information without distraction.
                        <br />
                        The <strong>1-column layout</strong> format is also
                        optimal for mobile making it easier to implement for
                        mobile support. Unfortunately, for this website, mobile
                        screens are not supported as it's not required by the
                        assignment.

                        <br />
                        The layout closely resembles the below.
                     </p>

                     <table class="table-layout" border="1">
                        <thead>
                           <tr>
                              <th class="layout-header">Header<br /></th>
                           </tr>
                        </thead>
                        <tbody>
                           <tr>
                              <td class="layout-main">
                                 <h4>Main Content</h4>
                                 <small>This is the main content</small>
                              </td>
                           </tr>
                           <tr>
                              <td class="layout-footer">
                                 <h4>Footer</h4>
                                 <small>Contains contact information</small>
                              </td>
                           </tr>
                        </tbody>
                     </table>

                     It is a very simply layout, but if you look around the
                     internet, most websites follow the same layout.

                        When deciding on the color scheme for this website, I
                        wanted a combination that felt modern, bold, and
                        visually appealing. I really like the colour red so I decided use 
                        tools like Adobe Color to generate me color palettes with a nice touch
                        on modern design. Given that I'm not so much of a designer myself,
                        tools like this can be really handy.
