                  <p>
                     As I continue learning more in this industry, I see my
                     passion for technology grow. My goal is to deepen my
                     understanding of computer science for as long as I study,
                     particularly in areas like software development and
                     artificial intelligence. Someday in the future, I want to
                     design solutions that not only solve problems but also
                     improve the way people interact with technology. In the
                     next few years, I envision myself working in the IT
                     industry, constantly learning and adjusting to new
                     developments. Whether it is creating software, architecting
                     secure networks, or even gazing into the possibilities of
                     AI implementation in the real world, I would want to be
                     part of innovations that shape the future. Other than
                     technical competence, I also want to contribute by guiding
                     others who, like me, earlier had no clear direction but
                     with an eagerness to learn. I believe technology should be
                     accessible to everyone, no matter where they come from. The
                     journey is just beginning, and Iâ€™m excited to see where it
                     takes me.
