                        When I was very young, my mom bought this pink ASUS
                        laptop for me and my brother. I grew up in a very remote
                        area where internet connection was very limited, let
                        alone interest in technology. I was your typical village
                        boy. While everyone were already using the latest iPhone
                        at the time, I was still stuck with a brick phone,
                        playing old school games like Snake, Tetris, Space
                        Invaders and some that I don't even remember. That pink
                        laptop, the first time I opened it opened a lot of
                        possibilities. The thought of internet at the time was
                        very interesting for me. I thought that was cool.

                        Around in high school, I became that IT go to guy by
                        myclassmates. I didn't know much about technology at the
                        time, but I was always interested everything in IT.
                        Around in early in high school at around Year 8, I had
                        one of this subjects called Computer something where we
                        learned basic HTML, CSS and Javascript. I didn't enjoyed
                        it too much and thus didn't learned much, maybe the
                        teacher didn't taught us properly that I never
                        understood it. I continued and finished my high school
                        without realising my passion for technology.

                        Right after high school, I enrolled in TAFE courses to
                        find out more about IT and my future in general. I knew
                        this industry would be hard, but I also knew there's a
                        lot of branches for me to explore on this industry. One
                        of the subjects of that course I took had Python
                        Programming. The teacher was very good at teaching and I
                        enjoyed his class. The first time I wrote print("Hello
                        World") in Python in Week 1 felt the same as I
                        remembered opening that pink laptop when I was little
                        and thus I decided to study Computer Science because I
                        know that's what I want to do.
